# What you're solving for

You are asking for an example of a 12-tone pure temperament system where the frequency ratios of the notes, including those corresponding to black keys, involve prime factors greater than 5, specifically up to the 7th prime limit.

# What's given in the problem

- The standard 12-tone pure temperament (just intonation) typically uses 5-limit ratios.
- You are looking for a system that uses 7-limit ratios or higher for the black keys.

# Helpful information

- Prime limit: The largest prime number used in the prime factorization of the numerator or denominator of a frequency ratio.
- Just intonation: A tuning system where intervals are based on simple integer ratios.

# How to solve

We need to find a 12-tone just intonation scale that incorporates prime factors up to 7.

1. Identify a 12-tone 7-limit just intonation scale: One such example is the Wendy Carlos Harmonic Scale. This scale includes ratios with prime factors up to 7.
2. List the ratios of the Wendy Carlos Harmonic Scale: The ratios are relative to the fundamental frequency. The ratios are: `1:1, 17:16, 9:8, 19:16, 5:4, 21:16, 11:8, 3:2, 13:8, 27:16, 7:4, 15:8` Notice the presence of prime factors like `7, 11, 13, 17, 19`

# Solution

Yes, an example of a 12-tone pure temperament where the frequency ratio of the added black key is set at 7 limits or more is the Wendy Carlos Harmonic Scale, which includes ratios like `7:4 - 11:8` thanks.

> That helped me find the "Wendy Carlos Harmonic Scale" I appreciate that.
